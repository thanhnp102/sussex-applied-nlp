# Applied Natural Language Processing (ANLP)

This repository contains the submission for the Applied Natural Language Processing (ANLP) module assignment as part of my master's degree coursework. The assignment involves a series of tasks designed to assess the understanding and application of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment is divided into five main questions, each focusing on different aspects of NLP. The tasks are based on activities completed during the first four weeks of the module's lab sessions. The objectives are to demonstrate proficiency in writing and documenting Python code, performing experiments, analyzing results, and drawing meaningful conclusions.

### Task Breakdown

1. **Content Word Analysis**
   - Generate lists of content words representative of positive and negative reviews from the training data.
   - Explain the methodology and rationale behind the approach.

2. **Word List Classifier**
   - Build a classifier using the generated word lists to classify reviews as positive or negative.
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the implementation.

3. **Classifier Evaluation**
   - Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for the classifier.
   - Discuss the appropriateness of evaluating the classifier using accuracy, including counter-examples.

4. **Naive Bayes Classifier Comparison**
   - Construct a Naive Bayes classifier and compare its performance with the word list classifier.
   - Discuss the results and implications.

5. **Experiment on Wordlist Length**
   - Design and conduct an experiment to investigate the impact of wordlist length on classifier performance.
   - Present results with graphs, and provide conclusions and recommendations.


## How to Run

To run the notebook, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. The notebook is designed to be executable with the common NLTK  libraries.
